rolling changelog / developer journal for your Church Management SaaS (CMS-GH) project.
Hereâ€™s how itâ€™ll work:

Every time we complete or fix something, Iâ€™ll log it with a âœ… entry.

Every time we start a task, Iâ€™ll log it with ðŸš§.

Every planned task will stay in ðŸ”œ until moved up.

Iâ€™ll also keep a date-stamped timeline so youâ€™ll have a full history when we package the final ZIP.
