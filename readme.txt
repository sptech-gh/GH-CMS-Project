// New branch
How to push a local branch to GitHub
To push a new or existing local branch to GitHub, follow these steps:

Create a new branch (if necessary):
Terminal
git checkout -b new-branch


Make your changes and commit them:
Terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"


Push the branch:
Terminal
git push origin new-branch








//SettingsController, migration/model (for configs), and the blade views so the link is functional right away?


add export button to donation.index.blade.php

//add inline validation error messages under each input (like @error('amount')...) so users see why submission fails

//add a global dashboard view (for super-admins to see all churches + global totals), while keeping this per-church dashboard for pastors/admins?


//
Recommendations (Based on Scope & Current State)
1. Fix Dashboard Stats (Immediate Priority)

Create a DashboardService class to fetch all stats in one place.

Use dependency injection instead of cluttering the controller.

Always scope queries to auth()->user()->church_id (or tenant id).

Provide default values (0) if no records exist, to avoid undefined variable errors.

2. Strengthen Multi-Tenant Foundation

If you havenâ€™t already, decide: subdomain-based tenancy (church1.yourapp.com) or single domain + scoped by userâ€™s church_id.

Standardize queries via a ChurchScope (GlobalScope) so that every model respects tenancy automatically.

3. Donation & Payment Flow

Build a DonationsService that:

Logs all payment attempts (pending).

Marks them as successful only after Paystack/Mobile Money webhook confirms.

Ensures dashboard reflects reconciled transactions only.

4. Event Management

Clean up event queries (remove null AND not null).

Add event repository to return upcoming, past, and ongoing events cleanly.

5. Roadmap Fit

Your scope (multi-tenant SaaS with churches, members, events, donations, analytics) is ambitious but on track.

Youâ€™re in the stats/dashboard integration phase, which is a natural point before final rollout.

Next step after dashboard stability = Payments + Analytics polish â†’ Deployment readiness.

My Recommendation (Action Order)

âœ… Refactor DashboardController â†’ Use DashboardService â†’ Ensure all variables are defined and defaulted.

âœ… Fix global tenant scoping (church_id) to avoid incorrect queries.

âœ… Finalize donations/payment integration with safe reconciliation flow.

ðŸš€ Deploy to a staging server (e.g. Forge or Laravel Vapor) and test with dummy churches.

//add a pie chart for donation status breakdown (successful, pending, failed) so admins instantly see proportions
