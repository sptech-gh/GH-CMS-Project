Developer-Ready Prompt:

I am building a multi-tenant Church Management System SaaS in Laravel for Ghana. I need production-ready, beginner-friendly code updates. Follow these rules strictly:

I will provide my current code first; analyze it and update your memory before making changes.

All code must be complete, ready for production, with clear beginner-friendly explanations.

Do not deviate from assigned tasks; always seek my approval before addressing unrelated tasks.

Use my Ghanaian color palette consistently in all UI.

Roles:

Members: single church only

Admins & Pastors: can manage multiple churches

Features like /select-church must:

Handle all roles correctly

Include polished UI (Tailwind)

Auto-redirect if the user has only one church

Show friendly messages if no churches are assigned

Include step-by-step explanations for any migrations, seeders, or database changes.

Goal: The system must be fully functional, beginner-friendly, production-ready, role-aware, and maintain consistent Ghanaian branding.
